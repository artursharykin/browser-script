# browser-script
I found myself a little frustrated holding ALT+TAB any going through all my running apps to get to Firefox when working on a lot of stuff, so I made this script to make my life easier. One of the benefits this scripts has over the "Shortcut Key" option in a Windows Shortcut properties is this script checks if you're already running the process & pulls it up.

## Compatibility
This script is NOT compatible with AutoHotKey v1.x.x, its only compatible with AutoHotKey v2.

## How to Use
Download the script and run it, in order to bring up the browser, press **WIN KEY + B** in order to start or switch to the Firefox browser.

If you use Google Chrome (or any other browser), just search and replace all mentions of Mozilla & Firefox.exe to Google & Google Chrome.

## To have it run on Start up
1. Press WIN KEY + R
2. In run command window, type shell:startup
3. Move the file into the newly opened "Programs\Startup" explorer window
